# Password-Generator

## https://sidneyedwards.github.io/Password-Generator/

## This Password generator is used to create a random password, using the users choice of password length and style of characters. The user is prompted with an alert to choose password length, upper or lower-cased letters, and whether they would like to use special characters. A password is then randomly generated from their selection.
